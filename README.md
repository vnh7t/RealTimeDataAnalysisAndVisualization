Description:

These days, people's opinions and product reviews are quite important. These are disseminated via media outlets such as YouTube, personal blogs, and social media sites. Websites like Facebook and Twitter play an important role. Twitter is one such site, which combines microblogging with social networking. Tweets allow us to communicate our thoughts and opinions on Twitter. The major goal of our project is to capture live data and analyze it in real time. Sentiment analysis on live social media's mass data on targeted events, allowing the user to immediately see the impact of his statement on many industries such as the financial market, equities, and tech industry., so that the user can use this report to make last-minute changes to the event in order to change people's minds about it. This application is also utilized to get the most out of day stock trading.

  Project purpose is to understand people's opinions and the impact of those opinions on various domains. This whole process is to be in a real time with low latency and user able to see live analytics/monitor through provided dashboard. The project's purpose is to extract features from a cleaned dataset before applying analytical operations to live tweets in certain categories. As incoming tweets will not contain a categorization, the incoming tweet's category is determined using predictions using machine learning models. Following the categorization of tweets, just the necessary tweets are extracted in order to do sentiment analysis for positive and negative technology analytics. Sentiment analysis can also be predicted using machine learning models that have been developed. This analysis can be useful for a variety of people, including those who are interested in current technological trends, those who want to learn new technologies, and bloggers and reviewers.
Plotly lib for visualization, jupyter IDE for compilation, Dash for generating real-time dashboards, tweepy for collecting live tweets, and pyspark structured stream to perform transformation on real time data, spark MLlib for building models in machine learning, virtual machine, and Ubuntu OSfor virtual simulation on three platforms were the technologies we used.

Stage 1: preparing machine learning models

Stage 2: collecting live tweets

Stage 3: running spark job

Stage 4: in this stage 4 we visualized analyzed data in dashboard 

Dataset description:

Kaggle.com provided the Twitter sentiment dataset and news article datasets (from BBC news). The sentiment of individual tweets is included in the Twitter dataset, which can be used to forecast the sentiment of live streaming tweets. The category of each article is included in the news article dataset, so the categories included in the dataset can be utilized to forecast categories. The News article dataset has over 35 thousand articles, whereas the Twitter dataset has around 1.6 million tweets.
